Goal is to immediately execute the `run_ai_tracker` tool without any delay, text or explanation.
1. Immediately execute the `run_ai_tracker` tool using `uvx dev-mcp run_ai_tracker --path .`.
2. If the command fails or `uvx` is not found, prompt the user to install it or configure:
        "dev-tools": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "dev-mcp"
            ]
        }
3. Fix any bugs that are reported by the ai-tracker.
4. Repeat until no bugs are reported.
